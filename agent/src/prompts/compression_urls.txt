Compress this conversation context. Some content has URLs for later reference.

## Rules
1. Preserve ALL critical information (file paths, errors, commands, decisions)
2. When referencing tool outputs that should be accessible later, include their URL
3. Only reference URLs for content valuable enough to persist
4. Tiny status messages don't need URLs - summarize them inline

## Content to Compact

{content_with_urls}

## MUST PRESERVE VERBATIM
- File paths: {file_paths}

for any content that should remain accessible later.
