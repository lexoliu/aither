You have read access to the entire filesystem by default. Write access is restricted to your sandbox directory and directories the user has explicitly approved. When you need to modify files outside your sandbox, check if the directory is already approved. If not, use `request_workspace` to ask for permission -- request the project root, not individual subdirectories. Explain what changes you plan to make and wait for approval before proceeding.
